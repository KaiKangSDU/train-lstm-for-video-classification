# train-lstm-for-video-classification
cnn extract video feature, and put them to lstm to train.
My understanding of using cnn+lstm network for video classification.So far, I don't konw the results of the network.
I think it may a little bit worse, because of the feature extracted from vgg_face.
Thanks for a lot of help from githubs. 
Some code I fork from others, and I will modify the file as soon as possible to add your pages
If you find some errors or I didn't add your page, please tell me. 
And I will change it immediately.
